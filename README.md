# Heart-Disease-Classification (Machine Learning)
## Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally and early detection and prevention are paramount to avoid the onset of such diseases. To detect and diagnose such diseases, healthcare practitioners must possess a wealth of data which will dictate the outcome of the patientâ€™s health status. More than often, the process of analyzing these data can be cumbersome. Machine learning provides novel and effective solutions to such issues. Its ability to help decision making and anticipate illness risk is one of its applications in healthcare. <br>

## Objectives
1. Explore different effective and accurate predictive models to understand patterns and trends associated with the onset of cardiovascular diseases
2. Identify invaluable insights and correlations based on their health risks and possible predisposition to cardiovascular diseases  through data analysis using different algorithms
3. Evaluate the scalability of the machine learning solutions on its use on identifying health risks in connection with cardiovascular diseases <br>

## Methodology
1. Data Processing Collection
2. Coding Process 
3. Discussion of Algorithms 

## Insights
Programming plays a crucial role in healthcare. Programming empowers healthcare by leveraging technology to improve patient care, streamline processes, enhance diagnostics, enable personalized treatments, and drive innovation in medical research and practice. The Kaggle notebook given  focuses on machine learning models for categorization of heart disease. Based on comparable patients' characteristics, K-NN algorithm can be utilized to predict if a patient has heart disease. It can also predict the likelihood of heart disease based on symptoms and risk factors

## Significance
The use of Python code for Heart Disease Classification with machine learning has several significance: <br>
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Scikit-Learn 
- Implementation Ease
- Collection of Libraries
- Reproducibility and Collaboration
- Philosophy of Open Source

## Conclusion
In the context of disease prediction and surveillance of cardiovascular diseases, a multiple of parameters need  to be assessed to form evidence-based diagnosis including patient's age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and  electrocardiographic results which are the common factors that are taken into consideration. Utilizing different machine learning algorithms has enabled us to gain insights and correlations about the patient's health status and their risks for developing cardiovascular diseases.
